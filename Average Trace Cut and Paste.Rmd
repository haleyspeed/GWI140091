<h3>"Clampfit Average Trace Cut and Paste"</h3>

For use with the "average traces" function in Clampfit.
A shortcut for selecting traces to average before analyzing the slope. <br><br>


<h4>The three variables that may need to be changed are:</h3>

- <b> start </b> -> this is the first sweep you want to analyze
- <b> intervals </b> -> this is the number of interstimulus intervals you measured
- <b> reps </b> <- this is the number of traces you want to analyze per interstimulus interval <br><br>

<h4>The default for the Powell Lab Paired Pulse Cycles protocol (Speed et al., 2012, 2013, 2015) are:</h4>
- <b> start </b> <- 1
- <b> intervals </b> <- 6 (in pseudorandom order: 50 ms, 500 ms, 100 ms, 80 ms, 30 ms, 200 ms)
- <b> reps </b> <- 10 


```{r}

start <-1               # Starting sweep number
intervals <- 6             # The number of interstimulus intervals
reps <- 10                 # The number of sweeps per interval

current <- 1               # Keeps track of which interstimulus interval you are averaging
while (current <= intervals){ 
    
    # Construct the line for the first interval
    rep <- paste("t", as.character(start), sep = "")
    
    n <- start + intervals             # Increment to the next sweep with that same interval
    i <- 1                 # While loop counter 
    
    # sequentially adds to the list of traces for the current interstimulus interval
    while (i < reps){ 
      rep <- paste(rep, ",t", sep = "")
      rep <- paste(rep, as.character(n), sep = "")
      n <- n + intervals
      i <- i + 1
    }
    print(rep)              # Outputs the completed line to paste into "average traces"
    start <- start + 1      # Resets the current trace to the first sweep of the next interval
    n <- start + current    # Resets the current trace to the first sweep of the next interval
    current <- current + 1  # Goes to the next interval and repeats the process
}

```
